# car-speed-detector-using-the-Arduino-and-IR-sensor

Overview :
  This projecr implements a car speed detector using an Arduino microcontroller and an IR sensor. The system measures the speed of passing evhicles by detecting interruptions in the infrared bea, and calculated the speed based on the time taken between interruptions

Features:
  IR Sensor Intergration : Utilizes an infrared to detect vehicles passing by.
  Speed Calculation : Measures the speed of vehicles based on interruptions in the                         IR beam.
  Arduino-Based System : implements the project using Arduino , Making it accessible 
                         and easy to replicate
